# Group To-Do List (Mon → Wed)

## Boyd – Bridge Implementation
- [ ] Set up **Bridge coupling** between the binary black hole system (Gravity) and the stellar model (FI)
- [ ] Test stability of the coupled system (check star COM motion and total energy)
- [ ] Run a short test simulation (few orbits or one close passage)
- [ ] Generate basic diagnostics: trajectory plot, energy conservation check
- [ ] Prepare a short explanation of the Bridge setup for Wednesday’s meeting

---

## Research & Writing Team
### Background & Motivation
- [ ] Research **tidal disruption events (TDEs)**
- [ ] Review **binary black hole dynamics** and relevance to TDEs
- [ ] Summarize at least 3 key papers:
  - [ ] Single-BH TDEs  
  - [ ] Binary BH–star interactions  
  - [ ] AMUSE or similar simulation frameworks
- [ ] Write short (≈1 paragraph) summaries for each paper

### Theoretical Background
- [ ] Derive or summarize the **tidal radius**:  
  \( r_t \sim R_* (M_{BH}/M_*)^{1/3} \)
- [ ] Include **Roche lobe** and **disruption criteria**
- [ ] List key equations for the report’s theory section

---

## Boyd - Code & Validation Helper
- [ ] Verify the **FI star model** evolves stably in isolation
- [ ] Verify the **binary black hole system** (period, energy conservation)
- [ ] Document system parameters (masses, separation, timestep choices)
- [ ] Create basic plots: orbital motion, total energy vs. time

---

## Visualization / Report Prep
- [ ] Collect plots and screenshots from everyone (star config, BBH orbit, etc.)
- [ ] Draft slides or an outline including:
  - [ ] Motivation  
  - [ ] Method overview  
  - [ ] Early test results
- [ ] Make a schematic of the **AMUSE setup** (FI ↔ Bridge ↔ Gravity)

---

## Wednesday Meeting Agenda
- [ ] Bridge progress + test runs (Boyd)
- [ ] Background & theory summaries (research team)
- [ ] Discuss:
  - [ ] Parameter choices for next runs  
  - [ ] Simulation priorities  
  - [ ] Division of report writing tasks
