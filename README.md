Stripping Stars: Tidal Disruption Events from Binary Black Holes

This repository contains the code and simulation data for modeling tidal disruption events (TDEs) of single stars interacting with binary black hole (BBH) systems, as presented in our study “Stripping stars: Tidal disruption events on single stars from binary black hole systems”.

Overview

In dense stellar environments, stars can be disrupted by black holes. In the case of a binary black hole, the tidal potential is time-dependent, and the distribution of accreted material depends on:

Mass ratio of the black holes (e.g., 30/70, 40/60, 50/50)

Orbital phase at the moment the star approaches

We simulate these encounters to study how these parameters influence accretion patterns, accretion disks, and potential feedback loops in black hole growth.
