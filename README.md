# SIMULATING-AND-MODELLING-IN-ASTRONOMY

This reposirory is meant for the modelling and simulating course at Leiden University. 
A course focussed around both computer literacy and the ability to model astrophysical phenomena.
The topic of interest, we are going to try to model, is related to tidal disruption events (when a star merges with a black hole and gets stripped) which includes pravity and hydrodynamic processes.

This repo is a work in progress but more  informartion about the course can be fount [https://studiegids.universiteitleiden.nl/en/courses/130588/simulation-and-modeling-in-astrophysics-amuse|here]
