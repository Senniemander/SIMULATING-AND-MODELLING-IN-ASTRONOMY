 # Simulating and Modelling in Astronomy
This repository is part of the Simulating and Modelling in Astronomy course at Leiden University.
The course focuses on developing both computational skills and the ability to model astrophysical phenomena using numerical and physical simulations.

## Project Overview
Our main topic of study is Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) — events in which a star passes close enough to a black hole to be torn apart by tidal forces.
We aim to model such events in the context of binary black hole systems, exploring how their dynamics affect TDE rates.

## Research Goals
Investigate how two black holes interact without merging.
Determine the critical separation distance between binary black holes that allows them to survive long enough to produce a significant TDE rate.
Study the effects of varying individual black hole masses and how these parameters influence TDE occurrence.
Explore possible extensions, such as clusters of black holes. 
Consider coupling with hydrodynamic simulations using Phantom (SPH code) and bridge methods.

## Tools and Methods
- HermyGrex – for gravitational (ch.4) and hydrodynamic modeling (ch.9)
- Hydro codes – to simulate fluid dynamics (ch.6)
- MESA – stellar evolution modeling
- Phantom (SPH) – smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (ch.6)
- Bridge coupling – combining different simulation domains ch.9

## Team Members (Week 15 – 23 Oct)
- Sanne – Lit research, hermygrex, Bridge coupling
- Kelly – Lit research, MESA, Bridge coupling 
- Boyd – Lit research, Phantom (SPH), Bridge coupling
